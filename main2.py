    # 0. There are a lot of requirements to create/use OpenCV projects. I used the following video to get started
    # https://youtu.be/WgPbbWmnXJ8

    # 1. Download the dataset specified in config.yaml
    # 2. Put the downloaded folders into your project and change absolute paths in config.yaml
    # 3. Change the following text to the correct relative paths for your project
    # 4. Run this
    # 5. Go to runs/detect/train/weights and use best.pt as the model while running shot_detector.py

    # Load a model
    model = YOLO('Yolo-Weights/yolov8n.pt')

    # Train the model
    results = model.train(data='config2.yaml', epochs=100, imgsz=640)
